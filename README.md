HR Employee Attrition Analysis – Logistic Regression
📁 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting employee attrition (whether an employee will leave the company) using Logistic Regression. It uses the publicly available HR-Employee-Attrition dataset and applies data preprocessing, modeling, and various visualizations to understand and explain patterns behind attrition.

Objectives
Predict employee attrition using Logistic Regression

Identify key features contributing to attrition

Visualize attrition trends and correlations

Evaluate model performance with metrics and charts

 Technologies & Libraries Used
Python

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn (LogisticRegression, train_test_split, etc.)

Seaborn, Matplotlib for visualizations

🛠Features Implemented
Data Preprocessing

Converted categorical variables using One-Hot Encoding

Dropped irrelevant columns like EmployeeNumber, Over18, etc.

Scaled data using StandardScaler

Modeling

Applied Logistic Regression to predict attrition

Used train-test split for evaluation

Model Evaluation

Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)

Visualizations

📊 Column Chart: Count of employees who stayed vs left

🥧 Pie Chart: Attrition percentage

🔥 Correlation Heatmap: Shows relationship between features

📌 Results
Model achieved X% accuracy (replace with your actual accuracy)

Visuals helped uncover key attrition drivers like OverTime, MonthlyIncome, JobSatisfaction, etc.
